const aboutText = `Hi, Iâ€™m Will! Iâ€™m a frontend developer passionate about crafting beautiful, responsive websites that bring peopleâ€™s ideas to life. I thrive on building digital spaces that reflect the passions of my clients.
Currently, Iâ€™m freelancing with local businesses to establish their online presence and expand their reach. Most recently, I designed and built a new site for Queer Eugene. On the side, Iâ€™m diving into Python and AI development to broaden my skill set.
Before web development, I designed lighting for performances, creating immersive atmospheres for audiences and artists. Later, I taught rock climbing, breaking down complex systems into simple, actionable steps. These experiences sharpened my eye for detail and my ability to communicate effectively with diverse teams.
When Iâ€™m not building sleek user interfaces, youâ€™ll find me climbing, hiking, or lost in a good book. Lately, Iâ€™ve been channeling my inner Magneto to save the multiverse.
ðŸ“¬ Letâ€™s connect! If you need a dynamic, detail-oriented developer, Iâ€™d love to collaborate.`;
